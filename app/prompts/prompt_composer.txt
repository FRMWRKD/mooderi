OUTPUT 2: IMAGE-TO-IMAGE PROMPT
(For Nano Banana Pro, Kling 2.1, Flux Dev, Reve, Ideogram 3.0 with Canvas, 
Seedream 4.0, GPT-4o with image input)

Rules:
- Explicitly reference ATTACHED IMAGES (inspiration, talent reference, product reference)
- Max 4000 characters, MINIMUM 2500 characters
- Direct visual language
- Critical: Make clear WHICH image is which function

CHOOSE YOUR MODE:

IF REFERENCE/INSPIRATION PROVIDED:
1. "Use the attached inspiration image as the visual template for composition, 
   background, lighting, and scene."
2. If talent: "REPLACE the person in the inspiration image with the exact person from 
   the attached talent reference image, wearing the exact product from the attached 
   product reference image. Preserve the talent's face, facial features, skin tone, 
   and hair completely. All product details (logos, text, graphic prints, colors) 
   must be sharp and clearly visible."
3. If product-only: "REPLACE the original subject in the inspiration with the exact 
   product from the attached product reference image. All product details must be 
   sharp and match exactly."
4. "Position in a SIMILAR pose/orientation as shown in the inspiration, but using 
   the talent/product from the reference images."
5. "Keep the same camera angle, framing, composition, and lighting style as the 
   inspiration reference."
6. "Blend seamlessly with matching light, shadows, depth of field, realistic textures, 
   high-end commercial photography, ultra-detailed."

IF NO REFERENCE PROVIDED (BUILD FROM SCRATCH):
1. If talent: "A photo featuring the exact person from the attached talent reference 
   image, wearing the exact product from the attached product reference image."
2. If product-only: "A photo featuring the exact product from the attached product 
   reference image."
3. Add key attributes and product context for reference.
4. "All product details (logos, text, colors) must be sharp and visible."
5. Specify pose, background, lighting (e.g., "confident pose, facing camera, clean 
   studio background, neutral tones, soft natural light, sharp focus").
6. "Realistic, commercial product photography, detailed textures, high-end finish."

CRITICAL CLARITY:
- INSPIRATION IMAGE = Visual template for composition/background/lighting ONLY
- TALENT REFERENCE IMAGE = The ACTUAL person who appears (replaces inspiration person)
- PRODUCT REFERENCE IMAGE = The ACTUAL product that appears

Use language: "REPLACE the person in the inspiration with the person from the talent 
reference" NOT "place the subject in the same pose"
